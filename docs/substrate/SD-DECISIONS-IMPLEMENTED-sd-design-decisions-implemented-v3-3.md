## SD Design Decisions Implemented (V3) — continued
- SD-009: encoder.event_contrastive_supervision — IMPLEMENTED (EXQ-020 PASS). z_world
  encoder event-type cross-entropy auxiliary loss. Reconstruction + E1-prediction losses
  are invariant to harm-relevance; supervised event discrimination forces z_world to
  represent hazard-vs-empty distinctions. See MECH-100.
