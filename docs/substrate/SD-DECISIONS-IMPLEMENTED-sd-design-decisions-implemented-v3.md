## SD Design Decisions Implemented (V3) — continued
- SD-007: encoder.perspective_corrected_world_latent — IMPLEMENTED 2026-03-18, FIXED 2026-03-18.
  ReafferencePredictor in ree_core/latent/stack.py. Enabled via reafference_action_dim
  in LatentStackConfig (0=disabled default; set to action_dim to enable). Applied in
  LatentStack.encode(): z_world_corrected = z_world_raw - ReafferencePredictor(z_world_raw_prev, a_prev).
  MECH-101 fix: input is z_world_raw_prev (NOT z_self_prev). EXQ-027 run 1 showed R²=0.027
  with z_self inputs because cell content entering view dominates Δz_world_raw and is
  inaccessible from body state alone. z_world_raw_prev stored in LatentState and used
  as fallback in encode() (falls back to z_world if z_world_raw is None).
  Biological basis: MSTd receives visual optic flow (content-dependent) + efference copy.
