"""A `subprocess.run` whose timeout path terminates the child GRACEFULLY.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`subprocess.run(..., timeout=N)` SIGKILLs the child when the timeout fires.
CPython's implementation is literally::

    try:
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate(input, timeout=timeout)
    except TimeoutExpired as exc:
        process.kill()          # <-- Popen.kill() == send_signal(SIGKILL)

SIGKILL is uncatchable, so the child gets no chance to run its cleanup.

For `git` that is destructive rather than merely abrupt. Git takes
`.git/index.lock` for the whole of any index-writing command (`add`,
`commit`, `status` -- it rewrites the stat cache -- `reset`, `checkout`,
`stash`, `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`) and registers a signal handler that
unlinks the lockfile on SIGINT / SIGHUP / SIGTERM / SIGQUIT / SIGPIPE.
SIGKILL bypasses that handler, so a timed-out git leaves an ORPHAN
`.git/index.lock` behind. Measured directly (2026-07-21, macOS, git 2.x,
a `git add` held open by a slow clean filter)::

    SIGTERM: lock during=True  lock AFTER=False     <- git cleaned up
    SIGKILL: lock during=True  lock AFTER=True      <- orphan

An orphaned lock is not a nuisance-level failure in this workspace. It
blocks `scripts/ree_commit.py`'s shared-index refresh, which leaves the
just-committed paths staged in the SHARED index as a staged REVERT of the
commit that just landed -- so the next session running a plain
`git commit` in that checkout lands the revert over the work. That is the
documented mode-2 hazard in CLAUDE.md.

Confirmed incidence: `REE_assembly/runner.log` carries 274 `TimeoutExpired`
tracebacks against index-taking git commands (`git status --porcelain`
timeout=10, `git pull --rebase --autostash` timeout=30, `git rebase
--abort` timeout=10), against 270 runner restarts -- i.e. the runner has
crash-looped on this, SIGKILLing a lock-holding git each time, in BOTH
`ree-v3` and `REE_assembly` (`git_pull` is called on both every loop tick).

USAGE
-----
One line per module, immediately after `import subprocess`::

    import subprocess
    import graceful_timeout
    subprocess = graceful_timeout.wrap(subprocess)

`wrap()` returns a real `ModuleType` whose `__dict__` is a copy of the
stdlib module's with `run` replaced, so `subprocess.Popen`,
`subprocess.PIPE`, `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` and friends are the SAME
objects as the stdlib's -- `isinstance` and `except` clauses elsewhere keep
working. The rebinding is module-local: the stdlib module is not mutated,
so no other importer is affected.

Behaviour is otherwise identical to `subprocess.run`, including still
raising `TimeoutExpired` -- callers that already handle a timeout keep
handling it. The only change is that the child is asked to exit first.

`run_soft_timeout()` (below) is the opt-in variant for callers that want a
timeout to be a FAILED RESULT rather than an exception. See its docstring.

    WHY. The runner's git call sites all branch on `returncode != 0` and
    already have a correct degrade-and-retry-next-tick path for a git that
    says no -- `_list_unmerged_paths` even documents "Returns None if `git

    so those paths never ran: the exception propagated out of `git_pull`
    and out of `main()`, killing the process. `REE_assembly/runner.log`
    carries 274 `TimeoutExpired` tracebacks against 270 `[runner] Runner
    version` startup lines -- i.e. essentially every runner restart was a
    git-timeout crash, respawned by launchd (`com.ree.runner`, KeepAlive).
    A transient 10s git stall on a contended laptop should be a skipped
    tick, not a process death.

    `on_timeout(exc)` is invoked (best-effort, exceptions ignored) before
    the synthetic result is returned, so the caller can LOG every timeout.
    Nothing here swallows a timeout silently -- the whole point is that the
    rate stays visible while the process survives.

    `check=True` still RAISES the `TimeoutExpired`: a caller that asked for
    failures-as-exceptions gets one. `on_timeout` fires first either way.
