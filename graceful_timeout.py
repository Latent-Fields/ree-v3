"""A `subprocess.run` whose timeout path terminates the child GRACEFULLY.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`subprocess.run(..., timeout=N)` SIGKILLs the child when the timeout fires.
CPython's implementation is literally::

    try:
        stdout, stderr = process.communicate(input, timeout=timeout)
    except TimeoutExpired as exc:
        process.kill()          # <-- Popen.kill() == send_signal(SIGKILL)

SIGKILL is uncatchable, so the child gets no chance to run its cleanup.

For `git` that is destructive rather than merely abrupt. Git takes
`.git/index.lock` for the whole of any index-writing command (`add`,
`commit`, `status` -- it rewrites the stat cache -- `reset`, `checkout`,
`stash`, `pull`, `rebase`, `merge`) and registers a signal handler that
unlinks the lockfile on SIGINT / SIGHUP / SIGTERM / SIGQUIT / SIGPIPE.
SIGKILL bypasses that handler, so a timed-out git leaves an ORPHAN
`.git/index.lock` behind. Measured directly (2026-07-21, macOS, git 2.x,
a `git add` held open by a slow clean filter)::

    SIGTERM: lock during=True  lock AFTER=False     <- git cleaned up
    SIGKILL: lock during=True  lock AFTER=True      <- orphan

An orphaned lock is not a nuisance-level failure in this workspace. It
blocks `scripts/ree_commit.py`'s shared-index refresh, which leaves the
just-committed paths staged in the SHARED index as a staged REVERT of the
commit that just landed -- so the next session running a plain
`git commit` in that checkout lands the revert over the work. That is the
documented mode-2 hazard in CLAUDE.md.

Confirmed incidence: `REE_assembly/runner.log` carries 274 `TimeoutExpired`
tracebacks against index-taking git commands (`git status --porcelain`
timeout=10, `git pull --rebase --autostash` timeout=30, `git rebase
--abort` timeout=10), against 270 runner restarts -- i.e. the runner has
crash-looped on this, SIGKILLing a lock-holding git each time, in BOTH
`ree-v3` and `REE_assembly` (`git_pull` is called on both every loop tick).

USAGE
-----
One line per module, immediately after `import subprocess`::

    import subprocess
    import graceful_timeout
    subprocess = graceful_timeout.wrap(subprocess)

`wrap()` returns a real `ModuleType` whose `__dict__` is a copy of the
stdlib module's with `run` replaced, so `subprocess.Popen`,
`subprocess.PIPE`, `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` and friends are the SAME
objects as the stdlib's -- `isinstance` and `except` clauses elsewhere keep
working. The rebinding is module-local: the stdlib module is not mutated,
so no other importer is affected.

Behaviour is otherwise identical to `subprocess.run`, including still
raising `TimeoutExpired` -- callers that already handle a timeout keep
handling it. The only changes are that the child is asked to exit first,
and that the post-SIGKILL drain of its pipes is BOUNDED, so `timeout=`
stays a real wall-clock ceiling even when a surviving grandchild still
holds them open. See `DEFAULT_REAP_SECONDS`.

`run_soft_timeout()` (below) is the opt-in variant for callers that want a
timeout to be a FAILED RESULT rather than an exception. See its docstring.

# Return code carried by the synthetic CompletedProcess `run_soft_timeout`
# hands back on a timeout. 124 is what `timeout(1)` exits with, and it is
# outside git's own exit-code range, so a caller that wants to distinguish
# "git said no" from "git never answered" can, while every caller that only
# checks `returncode != 0` needs no change at all.
TIMEOUT_RETURNCODE = 124

# How long to let the child clean up after SIGTERM before escalating to
# SIGKILL. Unlinking a lockfile is microseconds; this only has to cover a
# heavily loaded machine getting the process scheduled. Kept short so a
# child that ignores SIGTERM cannot extend the caller's timeout budget by
# much.
DEFAULT_GRACE_SECONDS = 5.0

# How long to keep draining the child's pipes AFTER the SIGKILL before
# giving up on the streams entirely.
#
# WHY THIS BOUND EXISTS. A killed child does not necessarily close the pipes
# the caller is reading: every process the child spawned INHERITED the same
# write ends, so the read side sees EOF only when the LAST descendant exits.
# Draining without a bound therefore makes the caller's `timeout=` unenforceable.
#
# Measured 2026-07-21 (macOS): `git add` on a file whose clean filter is
# `sleep 120`. git takes SIGTERM, unlinks its lockfile and exits promptly --
# but the filter process survives holding git's stderr, verified with `lsof`
# (the filter's fd 2 is the SAME pipe as git's fd 2; only fd 1 is re-plumbed
# to git). A `run(..., timeout=30)` returned after ~120s: the grandchild's
# lifetime, not the caller's timeout. The callers here are unattended loops
# (serve.py's 5-minute `_auto_pull` thread, the hourly igw tick), where a
# multi-minute stall is a real stall.
#
# NOT stdlib-identical, in either direction. On POSIX, CPython's `run()` does
# NOT re-drain after the kill -- it does `process.wait()` and lifts the partial
# output off the `TimeoutExpired` that `_communicate` already populated
# (verified against 3.13's source; the bare `communicate()` is the _mswindows
# branch only, where the reads live on child threads that must be joined). So
# the unbounded drain this replaces was a deviation THIS module introduced when
# it grew the SIGTERM escalation, not inherited behaviour. Bounding it restores
# the stdlib's wall-clock guarantee while keeping the one thing the re-drain
# buys: output the child emitted between the SIGTERM and its death.
#
# Two seconds is generous for the ordinary case, where the killed child was
# the only pipe holder and the read hits EOF immediately.

    either way, carrying whatever output was captured, so callers see the
    same exception they see today.

    The post-SIGKILL drain is bounded by `reap` seconds, so
    `timeout + grace + reap` is a genuine wall-clock ceiling
    even when a surviving GRANDCHILD still holds the inherited pipes. See
    `DEFAULT_REAP_SECONDS`. Giving up on the STREAMS is not giving up on the

    version` startup lines -- i.e. essentially every runner restart was a
